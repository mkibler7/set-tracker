# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-26

SetTracker provides a workout logging application that allows users to create accounts and store workout-related data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

- Email address
- Password (stored as a secure hash, not in plain text)
- Display name/First name (if provided)

### Workout Data You Provide

- Workouts, exercises, sets, notes, and related training metadata you enter into the app.

### Technical Data

We may collect basic technical logs needed to operate and secure the service (e.g., error logs, request metadata). We do not sell your personal information.

## How We Use Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Create and manage your account
- Authenticate you and maintain session security
- Provide core functionality (saving and retrieving your workouts)
- Send operational emails (email verification, password reset)
- Diagnose bugs and improve reliability

## Cookies

SetTracker uses cookies to support authentication and session management. Authentication cookies are HttpOnly to reduce exposure to client-side scripts.

## Data Storage and Sharing

- Your data is stored in our database (MongoDB Atlas).
- We use an email provider (SMTP currently; planned migration to Resend) solely to deliver verification and password reset emails.
- We do not sell your data. We do not share personal data with third parties except as necessary to provide the service (e.g., email delivery, infrastructure hosting).

## Data Retention

We retain account and workout data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. You may request deletion (see below).

## Your Choices

You may:

- Update your account information within the app (as supported)
- Request account deletion and associated data deletion by contacting: michael.kibler.dev@gmail.com

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including secure password hashing and session protections. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will reflect the most recent changes.
